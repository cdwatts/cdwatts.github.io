    <h1><bold>Largest Direct Actions Throughout U.S. History</bold></h1>
  
    <h4>Purpose:</h4>
      
    <p>Throughout U.S. history, there are been various social movements that have been the catalysts of change and have made the world what it is today. Direct actions such as protests, rallies, marches, and public demonstrations have been utilized to propel such movements forward. This data visualization would show how many people have been in attendance at the largest direct actions that have taken place in Washington D.C for various social movements in the U.S. It would also depict what percentage of the population this number makes up, in order to determine how many people are needed to take action in order to bring about change.</p>
      
    <p>Based on data availability, this project could either focus on the most influential direct actions from 1950-present using multiple data sources with crowd estimates, or it could focus solely on recent direct actions that have taken place from 2017-present.</p>
