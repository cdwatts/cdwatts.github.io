    <h4>profile</h4>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Claire Darling Watts. My professional work involves website design, creative writing, online communication, frontend web development, data visualization, and grassroots community organizing. I thrive in creative environments that value innovation and ideation. Before I was called to work primarily within the realm of digital storytelling, I started out as a computer programmer. In 2018, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Sustainability. Since then, I've discovered a passion for crafting online narratives using the power of the internet. If you are interested in collaborating on a website or writing project, let's connect!</p>

    <p>Experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, C, C++, C#, WebGL, assembly language (LC3/MIPS), AngularJS, GitHub, MacOS, Unix, Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva, Squarespace and Wordpress. Knowledgeable about UX/UI design, mobile application development, frontend/backend web development, data structures, algorithms, object oriented programming, 3D computer graphics, film and interactive media, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, computer architecture, English grammar, sentence structure, narrative and character development, event planning, project management and social media marketing.

    <h4>interests</h4>
    <p>I am passionate about intentional and creative design, social and environmental justice, community activism, leadership development, education, sustainability, travel and artistic expression. When I'm not designing, writing or contemplating, I am most likely immersing myself in the great outdoors, dancing like nobody's watching, traveling to far away places, or dreaming up a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
