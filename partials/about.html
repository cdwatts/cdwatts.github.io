    <h4>an introduction</h4>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Claire Darling Watts. I am the creator of this website and the human behind everything you see here. My work involves creative writing, website design, frontend web development, data visualization, travel photography and grassroots community organizing. As you might gather, I'm a bit of a human of all trades. I thrive in creative environments that value innovation and ideation. Before I was called to pursue web design and writing as my primary areas of expertise, I began as a computer programmer. In 2018, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Sustainability. While I do appreciate the complex thinking and attention to detail that coding requires, my love for crafting narratives with words and websites is undeniably more powerful. So that's what brings me here, time and again. If you are interested in collaborating on a website or writing project, let's connect!</p>

    <h4>interests</h4>
    <p>I am passionate about social and environmental justice, community activism, leadership development, education, sustainability, travel and artistic expression. When I'm not designing, writing or contemplating this thing we call life, I am most likely immersing myself in the great outdoors, dancing like nobody's watching, traveling to far away places or dreaming up a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
