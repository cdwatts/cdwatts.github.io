    <h4>profile</h4>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Claire Darling Watts and I am the human behind everything you see here. My work involves website design, creative writing, online communication, frontend web development, data visualization, travel photography and grassroots community organizing. As you might gather, I'm a bit of a human of all trades! I thrive in creative environments that value innovation and ideation. Before I was called to focus primarily on web design and writing, I started out as a computer programmer. In 2018, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Sustainability. While I do appreciate the complex thinking that coding requires, my love for crafting narratives with words and websites is undeniably more powerful. If you are interested in collaborating on a website or writing project, let's connect!</p>

    <h4>interests</h4>
    <p>I am passionate about intentional and creative design, social and environmental justice, community activism, leadership development, education, sustainability, travel and artistic expression. When I'm not designing, writing or contemplating, I am most likely immersing myself in the great outdoors, dancing like nobody's watching, traveling to far away places, or dreaming up a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
