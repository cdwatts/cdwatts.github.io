    <h4>an introduction</h4>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Claire Darling Watts. I am the creator of this website and the human behind everything you see here. My work involves creative writing, frontend web development, user experience design, data visualization, travel photography and grassroots community organizing. As you can gather, I'm a bit of a human of all trades. I am somehow a logical thinker, an intuitive dreamer, a clear communicator and a detail-driven creator all at the same time. I think that's why I am able to thrive in creative environments that value innovation and ideation. Before I was called to pursue writing as my primary area of expertise, I began as a computer programmer and web designer. In 2018, I graduated with honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and Sustainability. While I do love the complex thinking and attention to detail that coding requires, I also consider myself to be especially talented in the art of writing. It is my most honest and powerful method of sharing ideas with the world. And I'd love the opportunity to help you express yours.</p>
    
    <h4>skill set</h4>
    <p>Experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, C, C++, C#, WebGL, assembly language (LC3/MIPS), AngularJS, GitHub, MacOS, Unix, Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, Canva and Wordpress. Knowledgeable about user experience/interface design, mobile application development, frontend/backend web development, data structures, algorithms, object oriented programming, 3D computer graphics, film and interactive media, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, computer architecture, English grammar, sentence structure, narrative and character development, event planning, project management and social media marketing. Talented in storytelling, public speaking, team-building, problem-solving, design, communication, facilitation and leadership.</p>
    
    <h4>interests</h4>
    <p>I am passionate about social justice, environmental activism, leadership development, education, sustainability, travel and artistic expression. When I'm not contemplating things like societal issues, community resilience and existentialism, I am most likely immersing myself in the great outdoors, dancing like nobody's watching, traveling to far away places or taking action alongside my community to create a more equitable world.</p>
