    <p>Description: This program allows the user to create an SOR 3D object that is colored and lighted with diffuse lighting. When the "Create SOR" button is pressed, the user can draw a polyline in order to make the colored SOR object, which is then saved to a file. The "Flat/Smooth Shading" button allows the user to toggle between displaying the SOR with flat shading or smooth shading. The user can choose to display or hide the surface normals by clicking on the toggle button that says "Show Surface Normals". Clicking on the "Specular Lighting" toggle button will display the SOR with specular lighting(that I think may not be accurately shown), and sliding the "Glossiness" bar will change the glossiness value and affect how the specular lighting looks on the display. The user can also load an SOR from a file by clicking on the "Choose File" button and then clicking on the "Extract SOR" button, which displays the wire frame of the SOR on the screen.</p>
