    <p>Description: This program allows the user to set up a scene of multiple 3D SOR objects that are colored and lighted. The user can load an SOR from a file by clicking on the "Choose File" button and then clicking on the "Extract SOR" button, which displays the SOR on the screen. Doing this multiple times will display multiple loaded SORs. The user can pick an object by left-clicking on it. The current picked object will be shown in gray. To unpick an object, the user can click on the white background or pick a different object. When an object is picked, the user can apply transformations to it. To scale the object, the user can scroll up to make it larger and scroll down to make it bigger. To rotate the object about the Z axis, the user can right click and move the mouse horizontally. To rotate the object about the X axis, the user can right click and move the mouse vertically. For both types of rotation, the picked SOR will be rotated by 10 degree increments whenever the mouse is released. To translate the picked SOR, the user can left click on the object and move the mouse to its desire position, which will show the SOR in its translated location once the mouse is released. Clicking on the "Orthographic/Perspective" button enables the user to switch between orthographic and perspective view. The "Flat/Smooth Shading" button allows the user to toggle between displaying the SORs with flat shading or smooth shading when an SOR is picked. Clicking on the "Create SOR" button will enable the user to draw a polyline in order to make a new colored SOR object, which is then saved to a file. </p>
