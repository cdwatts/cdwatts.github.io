    <p>Description: This program allows the user to create an SOR 3D object that is colored and lighted by two light sources with diffuse lighting. When the "Create SOR" button is pressed, the user can draw a polyline in order to make the colored SOR object, which is then saved to a file. The red line signifies directional light, and the yellow cube signifies point light. Clicking on either the red line or the yellow cube will enable to user to turn these light sources on and off, which affects how the SOR color is displayed. Clicking on the "Orthographic/Perspective" button enables the user to switch between orthographic and perspective view. The "Flat/Smooth Shading" button allows the user to toggle between displaying the SOR with flat shading or smooth shading. The user can choose to display or hide the surface normals by clicking on the toggle button that says "Show Surface Normals". The user can also load an SOR from a file by clicking on the "Choose File" button and then clicking on the "Extract SOR" button, which displays the wire frame of the SOR on the screen.</p>
