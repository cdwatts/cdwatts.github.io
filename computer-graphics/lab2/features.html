    <p>Description: This program allows the user to create or read and SOR 3D object that is colored with diffuse lighting and flat shading. When the Create SOR button is pressed, the user can draw a polyline in order to make the colored SOR object, which is then saved to a file. Once the user has created an SOR object, they can choose to display or hide its surface normals by clicking on the toggle button that says Show Surface Normals. The user can also load an SOR from a file that displays on the screen when the Extract SOR button is pressed. </p>
