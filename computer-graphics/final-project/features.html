    <p>Description: This program allows the user to create a textured SOR object. Note that specific browers like Internet Explorer must be used. Clicking on the "Create SOR" button will allow the user to draw a polyline that will generate the SOR once the right mouse is pressed. The SOR will be displayed with texture mapping of the image sky.jpg. The user can change the view by clicking on the "Orthographic/Perspective" button. The user can also choose to pan the scene in either view by left-clicking and then dragging the mouse left, right, up, or down.

    <p>Description: This program allows the user to set up a scene of multiple 3D SOR objects that are colored and lighted. To do so, the user must load an SOR from a file by clicking on the "Choose File" button and then clicking on the "Extract SOR" button, which displays the SOR on the screen. Doing this multiple times will display multiple loaded SORs. Note that using the "Create SOR" button will only enable the user to draw a polyline in order to make one new colored SOR object at a time, which is then saved to a file. Once the scene has been set up using extracted SORs, the user can choose to zoom, pan, or move the camera. To zoom in or out, the scene must be displayed with perspective view and no objects can be selected. Scrolling up will zoom in, and scrolling down will zoom out. To pan, the scene can be displayed with either orthographic or perspective view and no objects can be selected. Left-clicking on the background while moving the mouse left or right will pan along X, and left-clicking while moving the mouse up or down will pan along Y. To move the camera in or out, the scene must be displayed with either orthographic or perspective view and no objects can be selected. Note that moving the camera in orthographic view will cause the scene to look unchanged. Right-clicking on the background and then scrolling up or down will move the camera in or out respectively. The user can pick an object by left-clicking on it. The current picked object will be shown in gray. To unpick an object, the user can click on the white background or pick a different object. When an object is picked, the user can apply transformations to it. To scale the object, the user can scroll up to make it larger and scroll down to make it bigger. To rotate the object about the Z axis, the user can right click and move the mouse horizontally. To rotate the object about the X axis, the user can right click and move the mouse vertically. For both types of rotation, the picked SOR will be rotated by 10 degree increments whenever the mouse is released. To translate the picked SOR, the user can left click on the object and move the mouse to its desire position, which will show the SOR in its translated location once the mouse is released. Clicking on the "Orthographic/Perspective" button enables the user to switch between orthographic and perspective view. The "Flat/Smooth Shading" button allows the user to toggle between displaying the SORs with flat shading or smooth shading. Clicking on the "Specular Lighting" button will display the SOR with specular lighting, and moving the Glossiness slider will make it brighter/shiner depending on the value. Specular lighting works with both types of shading.</p>
